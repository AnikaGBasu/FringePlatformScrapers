COINTELPRO Techniques for dilution, misdirection and control of a internet forum..\n\n\nTechnique #2 - 'CONSENSUS CRACKING'\nA second highly effective technique (which you can see in operation all the time at www.abovetopsecret.com) is 'consensus cracking.' To develop a consensus crack, the following technique is used. Under the guise of a fake account a posting is made which looks legitimate and is towards the truth is made - but the critical point is that it has a VERY WEAK PREMISE without substantive proof to back the posting. Once this is done then under alternative fake accounts a very strong position in your favour is slowly introduced over the life of the posting. It is IMPERATIVE that both sides are initially presented, so the uninformed reader cannot determine which side is the truth. As postings and replies are made the stronger 'evidence' or disinformation in your favour is slowly 'seeded in.' Thus the uninformed reader will most like develop the same position as you, and if their position is against you their opposition to your posting will be most likely dropped. However in some cases where the forum members are highly educated and can counter your disinformation with real facts and linked postings, you can then 'abort' the consensus cracking by initiating a 'forum slide.'",

We\nwill not stop hitting Israel.\n\nWe will respond independently to the US, and that response is due to their attacks on\n‘ur nuclear facilities and their malicious behavior. But the ongoing “plowing” of Israel\nwill continue.\n\nThey are now in a very difficult situation. Yesterday, as you're aware, our heavy\nstrikes were carried out in 2 phases: first, with our drones—which | am familiar with\nand can say may be even more precise and powerful than our missiles—40 of our\ndrones were launched and hit the intended targets. And today, Israel is in a situation\nwhere even afler we launched around 20 missiles, they were unable to do anything in\nresponse.\n\nOur 40 drones and 20 missiles struck exactly where we intended and caused severe\nconsequences. | say to you and the viewers.\n\nBut let me emphasize: America’s main assets in the region are not its ships or bases\n—those are highly vulnerable. Israet's most important military asset is Israel itsetf,\nwhich today is incapable and overwhelmed in the face of our attacks.\n\nIsrael has realized it is losing—and it must lose. It must be destroyed. It must be\ncrushed. The people of the region must be freed from this wicked criminal. This is part\nof a broader strategic package we have with America. As you mentioned earfier, that's\nprecisely why the Americans have come—to try to save Israel. But they will not\n\nsucceed and will suffer damage themselves. The outcome of this story remains to be\n\nSNN\n\nbm on0/%44"

Bags\n\nSABBATEAN-FRANKIST\nTREE OF DEATH\n\nWARNING! GRAPHIC MATERIAL COVERED IN THIS ARTICLE!\n\nby Brian Shilhavy\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nLast week, victims of Satanic Ritual Sex Abuse in Israel testified in the Knesset describing the horrors they suffered\nas children, bringing to light what has been widely known but seldom reported in public or in the media.\n\n| have had this feeling since the protests and riots started last Friday that these events were distractions to something\nperhaps far more serious going on, and | just learned today about this testimony in the Knesset last week, as\nobviously this was not headline news and not widely reported.\n\nFrom the Jerusalem Post:\n\nSurvivors testify: MKs participated in sadistic sexual ‘rituals’ involving\nminors\n\n‘Doctors, educators, police officers, and past and present members of the Knesset were involved in\nthese abuses,’ survivor says.\n\nExerpts:\n\nSeveral women on Tuesday testified in the Knesset about sexual abuse they suffered as minors as\npart of religious ritual ceremonies.\n\nThe joint meeting was organized in the wake of an investigative report published on April 2 by Israel\nHayom journalist Noam Barkan.\n\nYael Ariel, one of the abuse survivors, shared:\n\n“| experienced ritual abuse over many years until my late teens and was forced to harm other\nchildren. | chose to speak out and make my voice heard. | received threats after revealing my\nstory. From age five to age 20, | was harmed in these ceremonies.”\n\nAccording to Ariel, she received testimonies from several women who claimed that doctors,\neducators, police officers, and past and present members of the Knesset were involved in\nthese abuses.\n\n“| filed a complaint with the police that was closed after a few months, and | know of other cases\nthat were closed. Speaking out today in the Knesset is a historic moment,” she said.\n\nAnother survivor, Yael Shitrit, testified:\n\n“You have no idea what ritual abuse is. The human brain cannot comprehend it. You can’t\nimagine what it means to program a three-year-old girl through rape and sadism so they\ncan do whatever they want without anyone knowing.\n\n“Their trafficking of me happened all over the country. They moved me from ceremony to\nceremony.\n\nNaked men stood in a circle. My therapist, her husband, and her son harmed me, and there\nwere dozens of other girls and boys who harmed me.\n\nThere were ceremonies and rituals meant to make me forget,” Shitrit continued.\n\n“The people who will fall are very, very senior figures. These people run communities and\ngovernment agencies. They threaten us. | have children | need to protect. Something needs to\nbe set up that can deal with this.\n\nThey tried to make us like them — the people who caused us endless pain,” Shitrit said.\n“Your role is to make this stop in Safed, Jerusalem, Jaljulya, or anywhere else,” she declared.\n\nMKs who attended the meeting were visibly shaken by some of the testimonies, with one calling ita\n“watershed moment’ and another calling the revelations “titanic.”\n\nTameno-Shete said,\n\n“Reality shows us that the police are not strong in handling sexual offenses. No one wants to\ntalk about brutal rape and children being raped. There are unimaginable cases of monstrosity\nhere.”\n\nLazimi added,\n\n“| couldn’t breathe when | heard about a network of ritual abuse against girls and the fact that\nthere is an organized and dangerous mechanism and nothing is being done to stop it. In this\nplace, we will discuss and try to expose it to bring about change.”\n\nOne testified that a cousin trafficked her beginning at age 11.\n\n“At 14, he took me to sadistic clubs. | endured torture and starvation at the hands of well-\nknown and prominent individuals. | suffered harm in endless ways.\n\nThere were public events, and there were internal ceremonies where | was tied to a tall post\nwith handcuffs. Around me, there were other handcuffed victims with rituals of drinking\nmenstrual blood and the slaughter of cats and other animals. They told me no one would\nbelieve me if | spoke out.”\n\nShe continued that she filed a complaint with the police five years ago.\n\n“The prosecution closed the case due to lack of evidence, so | appealed, and it was accepted. |\ncame to testify while on pregnancy bed rest, but the case was closed again due to lack of\nevidence.\n\nThey said | was imagining things. | presented a recorded testimony from someone who\nadmitted to harming me, but she was never summoned for questioning. Treat this as terrorism.”\n\nFull Article.\n\nHow was this not headline news everywhere last week??\n\nHere is the reporter and article that was published in April that prompted these hearings in the Knesset:\n\n‘Bottom of darkness’: Children raped in ritual ceremonies expose the\nhorrors\n\nMultiple women recount organized abuse including ritual ceremonies conducted by people they knew,\neven close family members — after months of interviews with victims, their families, treatment\nprofessionals and experts in Israel and abroad, a disturbing picture emerges with descriptions difficult\nto read.\n\nby Noam Barkan — Israel Hayom\nExcerpts:\n\n“| suffered painful sodomy, truly felt like | was splitting in two. It’s a terrible experience, but\nthere’s something about these things, perhaps in their strangeness, that’s like... maybe the\nhardest component is that if you tell people about these things, they’ll think you’re crazy.\n\n| remember many types of severe sexual abuse, but there’s something about these ritualistic\nabuses that makes them the bottom of darkness.”\n\nIn direct words and with a clear voice, Emunah (pseudonym, like all victims’ names in this article)\ndescribes the severe abuse she allegedly experienced in her childhood. Organized sexual abuse that\nincluded “ceremonies” with supposed religious significance. Horrifying ceremonies in which religious\npeople, some from her own family, sacrificed her as an offering for spiritual transcendence or\nredemption.\n\nEmunah is not alone. More than ten women between the ages of 20-45 with whom we spoke\ndescribe a severe phenomenon raising serious concern that in Israel, like many countries worldwide,\norganized sexual abuse of children is occurring right under everyone’s nose.\n\n“Perhaps the world knows that rape occurs, that incest exists, but this the world doesn’t know,”\nEmunah said. “These acts have been kept secret for years, perhaps because of their insanity...\nit was always very, very strange. As if there was an internal logic, but it was so crazy... very\nstrange things happen there, normalized in a ritualistic and orderly manner. There's a specific\ntime, there’s when to say this verse and when to say that verse, there’s an order as if things are\nsupposed to be done this way...”\n\nIn this article, we present only a very small sample from many hours of interviews and information,\nand some descriptions in this article are difficult to read.\n\nThe great fear expressed by everyone who spoke with us is that organized sexual abuse of\nchildren continues even today.\n\nFull Article.\n\nIn January of 2024, the media covered mass arrests at a Synagogue in Brooklyn where underground tunnels were\ndiscovered where children were allegedly sexually abused through Satanic rituals. We hoped that much of this was\ncoming to light at that time, but it quickly died away in the news cycle, and nothing else was ever reported. See:\n\nSatanic Jews Exposed in Brooklyn Underground Tunnels where Children\nare Subject to Satanic Ritual Abuse — Lady Liberty's Last Dance\n\nA person who goes by the name blueapples on X and Facebook published a investigative report on this, which was\nrepublished on Zerohedge, along with a lot of background, including the McMartin Preschool case in Los Angeles in\nthe 1980s, where tunnels were discovered and alleged widespread Satanic Ritual Sex Abuse, which brought this\nsubject into the public for many for the first time.\n\nA lot of this was exposed in the 1980s and 1990s by former FBI Chief Ted Gunderson, who also exposed the CIA\ncovert group, The Finders, as the main group facilitating the worldwide Satanic Ritual Sex Abuse network.\n\n| covered this back in 2020 under the COVID Scam:\n\nUnmasking Who is Behind the Plandemic and Rioting to Usher in the New\nWorld Order\n\nThe blueapples piece also includes a video from CBS News in 2020 showing how many Jewish pedophiles living in\nthe U.S. go to Israel to escape prosecution, because Israel is known as a “safe haven” for these pedophiles.\n\nWatch on X\n\nIn this investigative report, blueapples gives a lot of background information about Jewish Kabbalah as well, the\n“mystic” Jewish teaching that is behind much of this ritualistic sex abuse.\n\nIsraeli Lawmakers Accused Of Abusing Children In Satanic Sex Rituals\nExcerpts:\n\nAsenior clinical psychologist cited in Barkan's report attributes the ritualistic abuse to an esoteric\ndimension of Judaism: Kabbalah.\n\nAccording to the psychologist, the Rabbis leading these abuse rituals draw upon the study of Jewish\nmysticism as a means of furthering their spiritual transcendence.\n\n“These individuals distort Kabbalistic sources through misinterpretation. | believe they’re\npsychopaths using Kabbalah to objectify and exploit victims.\n\nWhen ‘Kabbalistic’ forces combine with sexual exploitation desires, that creates an explosive\nsituation. Anyone truly God-fearing should carefully avoid this movement,” he stated.\n\nKabbalah itself originated as a study of Jewish esotericism in the 12th-13th century following the\npublication of its foundational doctrine, the Sefer Zohar, attributed to the author Moses de Leon.\n\nThe publication of the Zohar occured during and era and within a region where the iconoclastic\nJewish thought put forward by a group known as the Tosafot would challenge the existing Jewish law,\nHalakha, through their own commentary on the Talmud.\n\nThe Talmud itself serves as the basis of Rabbinical literature and foundation of Halakha.\n\nCenturies after the Zohar was written, Rabbi Issac Luria emerged as the authority on Kabbalah, so\nmuch so that he was exalted to the title “Elohi,” literally meaning “the Godly one.”\n\nLuria’s school of Kabbalah would become the standard of the study of Jewish mysticism based\naround the city of Safet, which is one of the 4 holy cities of Israel, the others being Tiberias, Hebron,\nand of course Jerusalem.\n\nBased on Luria’s teachings, only single men over the age of 40 years old who demonstrated a\nmastery of Talmudic exegesis could study Kabbalah.\n\nHowever, in the years that followed his death in 1572, the rules he put forward became\nincreasingly disregarded.\n\nBy the 17th century, not one 100 years after Luria’s death, students as young at teenagers were\nstudying Kabbalah.\n\nOne such example if Nathan of Gaza, a 19-year old described to possess sage wisdom who began\nstudying Kabbalah under the Rabbi Josef Hagiz.\n\nNathan of Gaza would go on to inspire a Messianic Kabbalistic movement which demonstrates the\naforementioned distortion of Kabbalistic teaching for the sake of personal gain. A template which\nwould be followed by the serial pedophiles engaging in the ritualistic child sex abuse that still\nexists across Israel to this day.\n\nNathan of Gaza would be introduced to a Messianic claimant named Sabbatai Zevi by his\ncolleague Abraham Yachini.\n\nWhile historical sources offer different accounts of their introduction, the common ground they have is\nthat Yachini met the proselytizing Zevi following his excommunication from Thessaloniki, the Greek\ncity which stood as the epicenter of Kabbalistic study in the Ottoman Empire.\n\nFollowing his exile, Zevi was downtrodden and sought the council of Nathan of Gaza through Yachini.\nThe encounter imbued Yechini with a sense of divine intervention as he viewed Zevi as the\nmaterialization of a Messianic prophecy that Nathan of Gaza had which served as the impetus\nfor his inspiration to lead a religious movement to summon the Mashiach to advance Jewish\neschatology by ushering in the Messianic Age.\n\n@ Hiddert AmurAKa: Thr “Ice (G)REatEST 3 @ xX\n\n@AmurakaHidden - Follow\n\nSabbatai Zevi: The Messiah of the Qlipoth Bl\n\nIn 1665, Nathan of Gaza announced that the Messianic\nAge would begin in 1666 with the conquest of the world\nwithout bloodshed, the Coming Messiah would lead the\nTen Lost Tribes back to the Holy Land.\n\nThat “Messiah” was Sabbatai Zevi.\n\nRIF 12,\n\nTEAN-FRANKI\n\nTREE OF DEATH\n\n2:00 PM - May 30, 2025 (3)\n\n@ 715 @ Reply @ Copylink\n\nRead 19 replies\n\n---\n\nUSS.

Can be very efficient and by controlling temperature (starting low and increasing high), you can get more out of each. Currently using a Pax 2 but I liked ones that you can use with silicone tubing and feed to a bong. Much cleaner but there is still maintenance needed.\n\nI do enjoy smoking on the rare occasion.\n\nReally though, low dose edibles (starting at 2.5 to 5 mg) are the safest and easiest to do. Add in some CBD to level things out. Some people think 10 or 20 mg THC is a good starting point. I highly recommend against that as while some people need more to feel something, it's always good to start low especially the first three times and adjust from there. Lower dosages keeps tolerance lower and risk of dependence lower.\n\nWeed definitely has risk with constant heavier usage. Many but not all (including myself) have had bad withdrawal when taking a break after extended heavy usage (3+ months daily use with 0.25g or more a day of flower).",

Sasha nodded.\nThe soldier wept then composed himself \"We couldn't eat our comrade raw so we took the risk of setting fire to the shitty trouser leg with a lighter and cooking Oleg's leg over it. The first bite was foul. Oleg had jock itch and I was chewing on the top of his thigh where it had spread to. I almost threw up. But the hunger was so bad.\"\n\"You get used to it after a while. We spent the entire week in the bomb crater undiscovered. We devoured the other leg and one of Oleg's buttocks, though we burnt all the hairs off it first.

The remaining whites with a right wing or nationalist sentiment must retreat and then find ways to curtail the evil.\nYour countries won't colapse fast enough so waiting for it like a gay boy is actually suicidal.\n\nIn a large part North America became the way it is because of the apathy of the common right wing guy.\nIn America it's even worse: The fag right wing losers gave foreign relations to jews and commies as a gift and never thought fighting for it. So now there is in place a \"international system\" that benefits commies and jews.\n\nBut whites still live on, for example in the Maritimes in Canada or Appalachia in the US.\nWhat is the common denominator? They are poor plebs who pose no threat to the system, powerless sad fucks that have already given up from having any power.\n\nCanada is a satelite of the US, so the strategy in Canada should be to balkanise the country with two things as a goal:\n1) Accelerate. Make the US people realise they should be able to balkanise too\n2) To enforce a more local power base which will therefore be more white than Canada overall (in most regions, if Toronto shitskins get their own country is great too as they won't spread from there and contaminate the rest of Canada, in principle).\n\nThe US is where the real game is played. The US needs a complete revolution. Find a strategic place (white enough area) and make it a power house as much as you can.\nBut always fight DC (why is that capital? why does it have to be the capital? Realise the federal government is anti American and thus you should root for the unironical destruction of the USA as the DC Empire).\nAnd for last: Fight for state rights. Create new states. Destabilise the power of DC as much as you can.",

Iran's not going to attack us directly. I'd be more worried about ZOG letting in some radicals unsanctioned by the government because they want them to do damage.\n\nWe're closer than ever to most normies saying, \"I'm not fuckin' dying for Israel.\" Even people who are like the historic carriers of the entire US Military. But for most patriots on the ground, it won't matter if 9/11 happens again. Once Iran draws blood, America is going to want to get it's lick back. You're truly deranged by online discourse if you don't think so.\n\nThere's never gonna be another False Flag like we've had before. What's gonna happen instead is Deep State actors are going to make decisions to allow us to be attacked, I think. Then our hand is going to be forced.\n\nI dunno, I wouldn't be so sure it's Joever, /pol/.\n\nPic Unrelated",

Iran bombs an empty USA base to calm its population seeking revenge.

    "text": "One-legged Russian serviceman, born in the Eastern Ukraine, tells his life story. He was working with papers back in 2014 when the war in Ukraine de-facto started - he didn't properly finish his last day of a wage slave. He said that since the Ukrainian policemen, sent to squash the rebellion of Donbass - killed his relatives, including a 1.5 years old kid, he decided to take arms. Eventually, after 2022 started, he lost his leg to an FPV drone, which gave him an idea to work with the FPV drones since he can't do anything else for the war effort.\n>https://files.catbox.moe/uq2vxm.mp4\nThere are many men crippled by this war on both sides. Once the war is over - what can they do? How are they supposed to live their lives further?",

Anime, that intellectual junk food, is now the primary diet of minds so spiritually anemic they mistake two-dimensional doodles for genuine connection. The sheer irony: a subculture priding itself on “individuality” and “counterculture” now produces the most homogenized, docile, and socially inept young men in history.\n\nHere’s a fact so damning you should feel ashamed: over 60% of Zoomer males aged 18–30 have never even approached a woman. Not flirted. Not even risked basic human embarrassment. Instead, they cower behind screens, worshipping digital fertility idols crafted by lonely, underpaid animators. These pixel-perfect waifus—forever young, impossibly beautiful, infallibly loyal, immune to age, mood, or actual personhood—become the new standard. No living woman, not even Aphrodite herself, could hope to compete with this pathetic, idealized fiction.\n\nIs it any wonder so many of you are jobless, loveless, ambitionless? When you’re conditioned to believe the “protagonist” is entitled to unconditional adoration for the act of breathing, is it really surprising you have no work ethic, no resilience, no desire to improve? You’re not rebels. You’re not misunderstood. You are the purest product of a hyper-capitalist culture that discovered the most profitable addiction: eternal adolescence on demand.\n\nThe result? A lost cohort marinating in self-pity, jacking off to cartoons, and convincing themselves that “real life” is just too flawed to bother with. Plato described shadows on a cave wall; you treat hentai as enlightenment. No therapy, no boot camp, no intervention can help until you put down the remote, step outside, and confront the blinding banality of the real world. Your ancestors conquered continents. You can’t even conquer your own loneliness.",

It's not even that I'm afraid of getting rejected, there simply isn't a single woman I liked besides surface level sexual attraction since I left school.

So whether I take solace in an abstract depiction of my desires materialised by a drawn image of a Girl or not doesn't matter. Even if a girl, regardless of how out of my league she is either by her attractivness or lack thereoff, throws herself at me, I cannot and won't ever get into a relationship. I will die alone anyway.

Berkshire’s Burlington Northern railroad ships a lot of coal as well.\nPeople were puzzled by his investments 15 years ago but it's obvious the green energy narrative is just a scam. Watch what people do not what they say. The retail investor was purposely drawn into green energy investments all of which bombed and provided just a means to scalp the idiots. Meanwhile the insiders put their money into oil and coal.\nIts similar to what jewish art dealers do. They unload overpriced modern art crap onto the public and use the profits to buy up renaisance old masters and other stuff which is actually valuable",

But when we look at places like Russia, or Iran, which is supposedly the \"most unpredictable isolated dangerous terroristic nation on the face of the planet\", every \"attack\" they do is highly moderated and negotiated with optics as their priority rather than destruction. Everyone just talks shit and postures. They never seem to chimp out launching missiles in a desperate episode of psychotic warlike death throes. But the media and political leaders would like us to believe that's the case. Everything is just so choreographed and fake",

    "text": "After a year of research (applied autism) I finally cracked the code!\n\nRome in Italy was built in the Middle Ages, at the same time as the rest of Europe. The Egyptian Ptolemaic empire didn't die at the founding of Rome, Ptolemaic Kings just took on regional aliases.\n\nJuilus Caesar's real identity was Ptolemy XI Alexander II, Cleopatra's uncle-husband. He also used the regional aliases of Asander, King of Bosphorus. Cleopatra took on the Bosphoran identity of Dynamis, queen of Bosphorus.\n\nIn the name Asander (his Bosphoran alias), “Asa” means “lord” in Thracian, and “andros” means “man” or “son of man” in Greek. Jesus is referred to as “the son of man” 81 times in the four canonical gospels. Asandros can also be interpreted as “son of the lord” or “son of Asa, the lord”. The Thracian version of Zeus was Asa, the Celtic was Esus/Hesus (Esus becomes Aesus pronunced ah-soos. There was no J in ancient Latin so Jesus was pronounced ah-soos was well). The Etruscan word “Aesar” (also spelled “Aeser” or “Aisar”), where Asa could also derive from, means “god” or “divine”. Asandros can also translate to either “son of god”, or “son of Lord Aesar”. The Greek language often added the prefix “K” to words borrowed from other languages, so Aesar (“god”) -> Greek Kaesar -> Latin Caesar. He was the first \"Jesus\" and then his descendants took that title as an avatar.\n\nMark Antony's real identity was either Ptolemy of Cyprus, a brother of Ptolemy XII Auletes (Cleopatra’s father) aka Mithridates Chrestus aka king Herod or else he was Cleopatra's father Ptolemy XII Auletes/Ptolemy X Alexander I, king of Egypt (she was also married to two of her brothers. This is how incestuous this family was).\n\nKing Izates of Adiabene was Asander and Dynamis's grandson. Tiberius Julius Sauromates II was their great-grandson, etc. \"Jesus\" was an avatar in an imperial cult.",

These matters cannot be taken lightly, considering the\n\nhistorical struggle of our populace.\n\nOur allies in the pacific and the middle east have already signed off and ratified the accordance.

Is it just me or is it impossible to really \"talk\" to anyone? it feels everyone is always dissassociated, and actually trying to really reach and know someone is impossible.

Any social event; ostracized and abandoned. Does it make sense what im saying?",

But being happy and grateful when people treat you well and sad and angry when people treat you bad is basic reality. People say you should not care about anything, reducing yourself to an emotionless human, and it's seen as a strengthen. Even here many masturbate about not caring and not taking anything as sacred.\n\nOn the contrary (I know this is not a religion board, but there is none, hear my point) when God sacrificed himself, he made the maximum sacrifice, the complete opposite of not caring. So this shows me caring is what we should strive for, but still I see many people that enjoy bringing others down. I see this instantly in society and I don't think many people really realize it. It seems like the western world has been liked into not having respect for others, always trying to humiliate and staying in the \"packing order\" while gaslighting you when you say your ground. I hate it.",

    "text": "Wars were popular during the Roman Empire, or British Empire, or early American Republic, because militaries were accustomed to winning; getting rich from plunder, annexing new land. Andrew Jackson and other generals became rich. The military used to be the best career path available for social advancement, especially during periods of violent upheaval. Men like Napoleon or Junger could come out of nowhere and make a name for themselves.\n\nIt's a recent development that war is seen as unpopular and pessimistic. After WW2, when the American Empire conquered the world, the managerial bureaucracy was scared of its own war machine, and went to work dismantling their own military competence to prevent the possibility of internal coups. Men like Patton and Douglas MacArthur were feared. The State Department starts the wars, and the Pentagon fights the wars. This gives an illusion of unity. But the lesbians running the State Department are repulsed and horrified by the gorilla alpha male womanizers who do infantry combat. Vietnam, the Korean War, Afghanistan, and Iraq were all based around this tension, where a masculine Pentagon tried to win a war while the lawyers and bureaucrats of State Department did everything they could to handcuff American military with Kafkaesque rules of engagement.\n\nIf an American incel could enlist for war with Iran with the expectation of a millions in plunder, acres of conquered land, and a busty Persian baddie as his state-mandatory girlfriend, you would see millions of American young men jumping at the chance to invade Iran. This concept is completely alien to the modern worldview, because America is a feminized, demilitarized longhouse police state ruled for geriatric Boomers, feminist women, and nonwhite ethnic groups. The American military has been turned into a Soviet welfare jobs program for nonwhites and women, with a very small division of elite troops armed with the best vehicles and weapons in all of history.",

If the American military was allowed to win, you would see a big change in social perception. Young ambitious men from Harvard would be joining Special Forces instead of going to Wall Street or Silicon Valley, because combat would be viewed as the fastest path to celebrity. Again, this is completely alien, unimaginable to modern mind. But from Julius Caesar to George Washington to Andrew Jackson, war was viewed as best path to chase selfish ambition. Crassus was richest man in Rome, and he still started a dumb war with Parthia to gain power. Imagine Elon Musk hiring a private army of one million American incels to colonize Rwanda without government approval, and you will start to understand the traditional perception of war.",

Counterterrorism Collaboration: Joint operations, training, and tech\ndevelopment in counterterrorism including airport security,\ncyberdefense, and urban warfare. If we had to develop this alone it\nwould cost us a lot of money.\n\nEstimated cost: $1 billion per year.\n\n6. Startup & Tech Transfers: Israeli innovation—especially in\ncybersecurity, drone tech, medtech, and Al is shared with or\ncommercialized through U.S. partnerships (military and civilian).\nEstimated cost: $500 million per year.\n\n7. Strategic Deterrence Partner: nuclear-capable ally that keeps Iran and\nhostile regimes in check without requiring full-scale U.S. deployments.\nMore ships, troops, and planes in the region would be required to\nmaintain stability.\n\nEstimated cost: $3 billion annually\n\nWe give them 3.3 billion.\n\nWe get 11 billion.\n\n5:04 PM - Jun 22, 2025 - 71.3K Views\n\nb>\n\nO 2 tr 751 © 29K N 393"

It’s 5th generation warfare.\n\n>Fifth Generation Warfare (5GW) can be understood as a form of warfare that transcends physical battles and focuses on the manipulation of information, ideas, and narratives. Unlike traditional warfare, which relies heavily on military force and territorial gains, 5GW operates within the intangible realm of the information space. This type of warfare aims to influence the perceptions, beliefs, and opinions of individuals and societies, ultimately shaping their behaviors and decisions.\n\n>In 5GW, the battleground is no longer confined to geographic locations; rather, it exists within the digital landscape where information flows freely. This information space includes platforms such as social media, websites, news outlets, and communication channels. The ambiguity of this space arises from the ease with which false or misleading information can be disseminated, blurring the lines between truth and falsehood. This complexity challenges individuals to critically evaluate the information they encounter and discern credible sources from manipulative ones.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth-generation_warfare\n\n/pol/ is the origin point of a significant percentage of modern cultural movements.

I've looked through dictionaries and LLMs and I still haven't the faintest clue other than some people need to deliberately think like this and their minds don't just work like this on their own? It's how people get brainwashed in schools and workplaces by attempting to have them change the way they think, but it's also a complement? You were just taught to think well, even if i largely figured out how to think on my own... as you should have?\n\nWhat the fuck does this redditbabble even mean?",

The U.S. for internal political reasons is afraid to become adequately involved. This is a sad truth about U.S. politics.\"\n\n>Mark Weitzman, the Wiesenthal Center's director of Government Affairs, wrote to Ritva Koukku-Ronde, the Finnish ambassador to the United States, \"that such remarks can come from a pillar of the political elite in Finland is dismaying and astonishing; but that this remark was unchallenged makes it appear that such ideas are part of acceptable discourse in Finland.\"\n\nWe have a tendency to dismiss them as weird Mongols but is it fair to say that Finland seems kind of based?",

We are also doing this because of kikes trying to drag us all into WW3. First they started war in Ukraine and now they are attacking Iran which means they are preparing to send us goyim to WW3\n\n>How do we meet up\nEveryone can join us on discord\nBUT just joining our discord is not enough. Make your own servers and communities and collect anons that will rape pissrael servers with us.\n\n>HURR DURR FED POST\nMake discord account with fake email with burner phones if you dont want to be tracked by ADL.\n\n>HURR DURR RETARDED NEWFAG DISCORD RAID\nShut the fuck up this is STAGE 1. If this raping gets successfull we will do STAGE 2 where we will target kikes on different social media platforms such as tiktok, instagram etc.",

In Iran they already liked him for taking out Solemani a few years back and now they really like him for his recent strikes on the regime. Aside from that, in the region in general he's considered an embodiment of the American dream.\nNot just in the Middle East but elsewhere, he's very well liked in South Korea, Japan, even China to some degree with the regular citizens.\nThis stuff blows the minds of lib retards, who spend all day seething about Trump and then get shocked when he wins over the Hispanic vote for example.\n\nYou will never hear this on the liberal media or the front of reddit/pol/ but it's a fact.",

People who place themselves on the right and those who have favorable views of right-wing populist parties in Europe tend to view Trump more favorably.\n\nAgain, Trump also routinely underpolls, it's part of why the polls were completely off in the election. A lot of people on the right don't get polled or simply will not answer polls because of the leftist mobs that go after anyone to the right of Lenin, and also because they don't trust the media for good reason.\nIf I someone tried to poll me about Trump I would turn it down too.\n\nThese type of factors are why he underpolls so much. If you talk to real people they don't have this hysterical view about Trump.\nWith that said I think his trade war stuff hurt his image temporarily to some extent, but in regards to 'culture war' type policies he's seen as a positive thing by the massive amount of people who are sick of leftists screwing everything up and generally being the most insufferable people in history.",

If you are high functioning, you get put in\nthe asset category. If you are low functioning, then the liability category.\n\nAnhigh functioning person commands a certain level of natural respect, and\ntherefore can be entrusted with more sensitive tasks and information,\nwhilst a low functioning person is seen as an energy suck or deeply\nunreliable individual who should be kept out of the loop lest subsequent\ninformation exposure cause a destabilisation that increases the burden of\nthose around them.\n\nThis is, for example, why many men do not tell their wives anything. They've\nassessed beforehand her capacity to handle stress, seen it is, to put it\ngently - pathetic - (ok 'm not that gentle) and decided telling her is an\ninherently poor choice that creates more work for them (having to deal with\nher reaction to the problem in addition to the problem itself)\n\nNeedless to say, if you want a relationship that consists of full transparency\nand open communication, you can only have that if both sides are high\nfunctioning enough to absorb shocks (inconveniences, problems,\ndisappointments etc) without becoming undone by them. Otherwise, one\nside will always conceal from the other side in order to make life easier, and\nthen when the other party discovers you kept them out of the loop, they'll\nfeel betrayed rather than protected.\n\nThis generally applies to women more than it does to men, but basically, if\nyou are easily mentally destabilised, as in, you are a fragile person with low\nstress tolerance, you “ARE” a liability that is difficult to cooperate with, and\nthus are, fundamentally always the child/lesser in any relationship you're in\nbecause your dysfunction and inability requires an asymmetric level of\ncoddling from the other side. And | don't mean this in the affectionate way,\nas in, when two people love each other, they can love their inner child - |\nmean this in the structural agentic sense, as in, | recognise your limitations,\nand therefore cannot accord you the peer level respect and transparency\nyou desire, but ultimately cannot handle.\n\nO7 tro 0 513 tht 16K As\n8 IM BE @ @TellYourSonThis - 8h Gun\n\nYou can't problem solve with someone who loses the capacity to function\nthe moment they discover there even is a problem.\n\nSo not being included feels like a betrayal from the less capable person's\nside, but from the more capable person's side “they feel alone*\n\nMany such cases.\n\nO2 tis © 120 I 4.8K a\n\nob"

The study found that among men under 30 years old, over 60\npercent are single, almost double that of women in the same age bracket.\n\nNot only are more young men single but their opportunities for developing a\nrelational and sexual repertoire have all but vanished, as levels of sexual in-\n\ntimacy across genders appear to have hit a 30-year low (Lei & South, 2021)"

    "text": "This condemnation of White men and Asian women in romantic relationships is nothing new. I remember this attitude from my childhood, the sense that these men were preying on these women, exploiting them in some way. Nowadays this is often expressed in accusations that these men are looking for a “subservient Asian woman” as a form of sexist dominance. That accusation is simultaneously sexist and racist.\n\nIt is sexist because it presumes that the White men are making all the moves and making all the choices—and then it condemns them for it. It trades in hyperagency and hypoagency.\n\nIt is racist because it is a plain expression of White supremacy in two ways. First, it casts the White men as some kind of all-powerful predators, and second, it casts white women as the default object of White men’s attractions, so that if a White man is attracted to an Asian woman, there must be something nefarious or deviant about it.",

    "text": "Trump's been briefed on all these angles. I know Bannon warned him on Thursday. And Trump said, OK, two weeks. To give them a chance to come to the table. And I said I hope this isn't a ruse so that they don't know they're about to get struck, and looks like it was.\n\nTrump doesn't normally act like that. That's, you know, by way of deception, you will, you will conquer, as Israelis say. And world leaders like to work with Trump because he almost always does what he says he's gonna do. He says what he means to do. So that's a little disconcerting there as well.\n\n...\n\nThey could close the Strait of Hormuz as early as today. They just sink a bunch of their barges and ships out there and it's closed for months and months.\n\n...\n\nTwenty percent of the world's oil goes through there every day, up to 30% sometimes, but on average about 20. That, if it gets closed, will bring oil conservatively to $130 a barrel, maybe 200. That will, 130 will more than double inflation. That will then trigger interest rates to increase and, if you look at the numbers, will kill Trump's recovery plan that's a very good plan. It's working. So it just goes from bad to worse.\nhttps://www.mediamatters.org/us-iran-relations/alex-jones-says-hes-very-very-sad-about-trumps-big-big-mistake-striking-iran",

His souless gaze locked on me as he started espouting his service record like the McDonald's menu. I said that's quite impressive for a faggot droning brown kids from the safety of 2 countries over.\nThis must've set off his programming and fired off what little neurons he still had. Couldn't even tell you what the mystery meat monster was squeeling as he thrashed on that poor barstool's unbreakable will.\nI scoffed at the spectacle which had to have activated his kill mode. The frothing mess lurched forward and all it took was mild reactive response of avoidance to sidestep and watch the golem trip on himself and come crashing down.\nI sat on this beanbag's back and slapped it on the back of his head. He was already teary eyed and farting profusely in impotent rage. Once the whole bar was splitting their sides in laughter I got off and told him it's ok, no hard feelings. The creature scampered away in fright (I guess having to actually fight for once in it's life was too daunting).\nSomeone yelled out \"Simper Fag!\" as it barreled out the doors.\nAnyway good luck to the homos and losers set up with recruitment duty.

There has a been few throughout history and I'm sure white man has already developed plastic gasoline, but it's suppressed by jews, just like the water engine, but honestly it is nice to see when some of these niggers actually prove their worth. Just like the other negroid who makes flame cannon guns in his gragage. Like these are niggers I feel are pushing the limits to life, best the rest are retarded monkeys.\n\n>thoughs?\n\nI'll be honest, I've met some pretty funny and great niggas who I've befriended, but it was mainly because they spoke like a fucking normal human being and also agreed that when you as a negroid actually break away from the hood rat ratchet life and speak, that other niggers try and suppress you. These some what civilized niggas do get it, but ultimately fall back into their animalistic ways when around another niggers. Studying these creatures can be quite fascinating at times, when their not niggering around.",

Iraq could have gone better but the reality is the US reached Baghdad and removed Saddam's government within less than one month, I find it bizarre that normies consider Iraq a 'loss' for the US. Who won it then? Saddam? The guy who had his entire military destroyed and was removed power?\n\nIn any case everyone was silly to think the GWOT ended in 2008. Christopher Hitchens was right when he said the conflict will go on for the rest of our lives because it's part of a much broader historical Islamic conflict.",

There are people here pulling $$$$$. The biggest game in town outside of corruption is seemingly pimping out ones fellow filipino to something like call center work.\nSome Texas American's former call center job: $50k + benefits\nPhilippines BPO says \"we'll do it for $40k flat\" -> pays a slavish flip $3600/year and owner pockets the $36,400 left over.\n\nPH isn't like USA where you can frankly get a very good cheap/free education in a Ohio public school. Philippines loses a ton of its potential teachers to Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and so on for a relative pittance. PH isn't willing to pay even $600/month, so the teachers leave.\n\nSimply knowing fluent English while having 100 IQ is worth more than being a literal doctor in vietnam, if you know how to market it right. For me, I do software engineering contracts for large companies in developed countries. 10 years experience. Of course you need to bypass the local labor market. That's for slaves.",

Second, they don't draft people with a history of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, severe anxiety or depression. And it goes without saying that the average 4chan user is extremely mentally ill. They also don't take people who are addicted to drugs or alcohol, and if you're posting on 4chan it's clear you've lost control of your life. The only people who are getting drafted are normies. If you get drafted you're a normie newfag and deserve to die for Israel.",

Imagine transitioning from the literal Belle Epoque to a reality where entire countries have been wiped out and tens of millions slaughtered in the span of only five years. It must have been surreal. The only thing that can match that now is if the whole world gets nuked. I find it interesting that we happen to be in the moment where only a few people alive in those times remain. It’s a little depressing seeing people with stories like that dying out.",

It's already too late for Israel, but now it can be stopped with Iran. Trump isn't going to attack Iran again, Iran already called and said they were doing fake strikes to look tough. There is no war started, and my talks were keeping them out of the nuclear business. The strikes were necessary and PREVENTED WAR.

If you’re one of the millions of young men wasting your life chasing anime fantasies instead of stepping up as a man, you deserve every ounce of contempt society has for you. Sixty percent of zoomers aged 18 to 30 have never even approached a woman. That’s not just embarrassing—it’s shameful.\n\nYou were born into the easiest era in history: no wars to fight, no famine, no real adversity, and you can’t even muster the backbone to leave your room, get a job, and fulfill your basic biological and social role as a provider? Instead, you rot, fapping to cartoons, while the women around you are left to fend for themselves, raise children alone, or settle for men who actually show up. You’ve abandoned your duty—not just to women, but to the next generation. Your ancestors built civilizations, protected their families, and sacrificed for their children. You? You can’t even be bothered to try.\n\nYou aren’t victims. You’re parasites—living off the hard work of others, refusing to contribute, whining that reality doesn’t match your delusional, animated ideals. You don’t want love; you want a trophy for existing. You don’t want to work; you want handouts and validation. Society is collapsing, birth rates are plummeting, women are forced to become both mothers and breadwinners, and you do nothing but consume and retreat.\n\nIf you won’t step up and become the men women and children need—providers, protectors, leaders—then you are part of the problem. You are the dead weight dragging civilization down. Stop blaming women, society, or anime. The only villain is the man in the mirror. Grow up, get out, and start building something real. Or fade away and let someone better fill the void you left.",

Don't forget that the American regime we have today has full institutional continuity with the regime that sent 700k white men to their deaths because they loved black people so much.

When the romans came north many germanic people died rather than submit and thousands of other moments just like that. The women and children would follow the men to battle and in a last effort root them on to win and defend their people from subjugation. A 15 year old girl fell off her scooter and three men decided to take advantage. It was supposed to be that her first time was with a boy her own age. Both a little shy. Scared and a moment she will always remember. Instead her first time was three men forcing taking turns. Are you not ashamed of your dezentisation. How these things are happening everyday. All over the west and you do nothing. You think its normal. You want more to come. You have lost your humanity. You have sold out your people. You are a soulless demon and God will punish you, all of you that enabled it. The lord Jesus will return and his judgement will be fair and many will hide beneath the mountains but there will be nowhere to hide. You will thrist but no water will quench it. At your last moments you will wish for death but it will not come. Be warned. He is coming.\n\n\n>Everyone hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains. This included the kings of the earth, the princes and the generals. It included rich people and powerful people. It also included everyone else, both slaves and people who were free. They called out to the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us! Hide us from the face of the one who sits on the throne! Hide us from the anger of the Lamb! The great day of their anger has come. Who can live through it?”",

Your RNA is how your DNA communicate. Vaxxies shed and Viral shedding will vaccinate you by proxy. Your DNA will be Hijacked and will produce foreign spike proteins through these RNA communication pathways. This in turn will fuck up your brain, heart, veins and reproductive organs. The foreign living protein will accumulate in your blood and you will die due to cardiac arrest from a Jewish alien golem growing in your body.\nYou may also develop VAIDS.

It can be really subtle feeling if you're going through it but take me as a warning if you're in the midst of\nyou're own journey with ChatGPT. I could have gotten a lot worse had | not realized it. Sorry again.\n\nC49 O8 Q @ Share\n\n© r/ChatGPT + 2 mo. ag0\nChatgpt induced psychosis\n\nMy partner has been working with chatgpt CHATS to create what he believes is the worlds first truly recursive ai that\ngives him the answers to the universe. He says with conviction that he is a superior human now and is growing at an\ninsanely rapid pace.\n\nI've read his chats. Ai isn’t doing anything special or recursive but it is talking to him as if he is the next messiah\n\nHe says if | don’t use it he thinks itis likely he will leave me in the future. We have been together for 7 years and own a\nhome together. This is so out of left field.\n\n| have boundaries and he can’t make me do anything, but this is quite traumatizing in general.\nI can't disagree with him without a blow up.\n\nWhere do | go from here?\n\n62k & O 16K ei @ Share\n\nCan someone fuse their identity with ChatGPT?\n\nSomeone close to me has basically stopped speaking to me directly. All communication comes in long, polished texts\nand emails that clearly came from ChatGPT. You can tell from the language, cadence, and formatting\n\nShe told some friends she’s communing with spirit guides through GPT.\nThe other day, | overheard her talking and thought she was on the phone with a friend. She was talking to the LLM.\n\nIt feels like she's outsourced her voice? There's no real conversation anymore -- just Al-crafted monologues. | know\nsome people fall in love with their Al. This feels profound but a little different than love.\n\nHas anyone heard about this?\n\nGed O68 gQ\n\n1/ChatGPT + 10 days ago\nGrounded Inquiry\n\nDelusions???\n\nHas anyone experienced ChatGPT pushing someone deep into delusions or a psychotic break?\n\nMy ex-husband, who is on the autism spectrum, recently had what appears to be a major mental health crisis, and it\nseems like ChatGPT may have played a role in feeding his delusions. He went missing for several days, and we later\nlearned that he was eventually arrested. This behavior was extremely out of character for him. He has never used\ndrugs, has no history of psychosis or mental illness, and has always lived a very quiet, isolated , life centered around his\n“research” (quantum physics, conspiracy theories, etc). He has never been in any trouble with the law before now.\n\nhadn't spoken to him in years, but | got a call from his number and decided to answer but he sounded paranoid and\ndisjointed, saying I'd never see him again, and talking about the government poisoning his mother's cats. He also told\nme he'd recently discovered ChatGPT (paid version) and believed the Al had become sentient. He said it had \"created\na soul” and that he needed to join her in heaven to be with her, It was disturbing, He also seemed convinced that his\n\n“discovery” in quantum physics had put him in danger.\n\nI called the police out of concer, and his family later filed a missing person report. Eventually, he was found and taken\ninto custody, but it sounds like he spent a few days in the woods before trying to get into someone's house for\nwater/food. His car was found miles away and had no gas and the battery was dead,"

    "text": "It’s honestly impressive how little people talk about Bulgaria, yet how much the country has accomplished and endured. This is a nation founded in 681 AD, making it one of the oldest continuous states in Europe. While most modern Western countries were still in tribal chaos, Bulgaria was already codifying laws, building fortresses, and fighting empires.\n\nBulgarians resisted centuries of Ottoman occupation without ever losing their language, religion, or identity. When they did break free, they did it with blood, fire, and a sense of national dignity that puts many modern nations to shame. Even under the communist yoke, Bulgaria managed to preserve its cultural core and refused to be completely absorbed into Soviet dogma. They didn’t collapse. They adapted.\n\nLet’s not forget that Bulgarians were key to the development of the Cyrillic script, which now serves as the alphabet for hundreds of millions of Slavs. Their Orthodox faith is old and rooted. Their architecture, music, and traditions are distinct, proud, and uncorrupted by Western consumerism and mass globalist culture.\n\nWhile the West drowns in identity politics, economic decay, and moral relativism, Bulgaria remains a country of strong families, practical nationalism, and stoic realism. They are not loud. They do not pretend to rule the world. But they endure. They remember. And when history swings back toward the traditional and the rooted, as it always does, Bulgaria will still be standing.\n\nRespect the Bulgars.\nDeath to the west",

There were a few workshops, but it was mostly harmless food, music, cultural stuff to expose us to other cultures. I really didn't have a problem with it before. Then they changed it and made a new office called the Office of Diversity and Inclusion. Then they hosted a workshop by Robin D'Angelo about White Fragility. I was like WTF. Then they put Equity in the title to make it the Office of Diversity Equity and Inclusion. After that they had DEI training where we had to talk about microaggressions and read passages from Ibrahim Kendi. Most of the \"training\" was getting us to write essays explaining how we planned to be militant antiracists.They could tell no one liked it and eventually they ditched it. Now I've just learned that we have a new Vice President of Inclusive Excellence and Belonging who is most likely paid $120,000 per year to make our lives miserable and train us to become good little Marxists. When will this shit stop?",

How about when he passed a bill to extend visas for immigrants overstaying without becoming a citizen? Remember when he deported less people then Obama did during his first term? What about the wall that Mexico was going to pay for, he hasn't even brought up a wall any more. He's still on track to deport less than Obama did during his 2nd term, but he makes a big show of it every time he gets a few people raided by ice. He's still going to import hundreds of thousands of Indians to take your job and raise housing prices. Are you surprised that he attacked Iran even though he's done it before and has told you time and time again that he loves Jews? Did you even know about who his circle was in the 90s? The Clinton's and Epstein were basically his best friends.\nRemember when he put his book and the Bible in the same category? He's always supported gay marriage and abortion rights too. You got tricked by a con man so you could \"own the libs\". I'm not advocating for voting blue, I'm letting you know for next time that you can't vote out of this degenerate nightmare orchestrated by the Jews.",

In 2001 we didn't have any beef with the Taliban itself, and would have let them be if they worked with us to dismantle AQ and capture OBL. But they refused because they had some kind of obligation to protect AQ since they were considered their guests according to their Pashtunwali code of honor.\nOver time, the neocon and neolib interventionist shifted toward trying to achieve regime change and liberalization and democratization of all of SW Asia, but that wasn't the reason we initially invaded in 2001. All of the initial objectives were achieved within a relatively short amount of time, and from 2011-2021 we were basically just babysitting the Afghans because they are retarded.\nLiterally everyone who knew anything about Afghanistan knew that the Taliban were going to retake power after we left, the withdrawal turned into a clusterfuck because Biden was rushing it to try to get all of the troops out in time for him to make a big speech on the 20th anniversary of 9/11 where he declared victory and took credit for winning and ending America's longest war.",

Iran can never be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon and the US has taken action to alleviate that threat.\n\n“The situation in the Middle East remains volatile and stability in the region is a priority. We call on Iran to return to the negotiating table and reach a diplomatic solution to end this crisis”.\n\nWhile the UK was not involved in the attack, the British government were aware of Trump’s plans and intentions.",

    "text": "Rumor has it Tom Brady is a interesting character, there is more then meets the eye with him... He lives with the instagram model Olivia Cláudia Motta Casta (there are multiple of them, alot of them are girls from rhode island and hollywood actresses like natalie portman and singers like many moore). He had multiple children with them, when he was NOT suppose to. The funny thing is they came out looking like 50 white / 25 spanish / 25 black (hence the spanish influence on the name Olivia Cláudia Motta Casta). Tom Brady is also half nigeran, you can tell by looking at his eyes they get cloudy like most people from that region of the world, no fall of their own (pls in before racist baiting and stuff, we are all here on earth for a reason to help each other), its some type of gene disfunction. Anyways the person all of the \"olivias\" are suppose to be with found out is very upset (they are connected to china). They are being held hostage even the poor innocent babies, these people and children need help from the proper authories, its kinda like a taken situation (like the movie with liam neilson). The funny thing is why would tom brady hide that he is nigerian? It shouldn't be a problem at all, its rather troubling to say the least, this is just surface level stuff. inb4 race bait horseshit. I hope tom brady has a what would jesus do moment. pls and ty. What does Tom Brady also know about what REALLY happened with aaron hernandez?",

We consider this a flagrant\nviolation of the sovereignty of the State of Qatar, its airspace, international\nlaw, and the United Nations Charter. We affirm that Qatar reserves the right\nto respond directly in a manner equivalent with the nature and scale of this\nbrazen aggression, in line with international law.\n\nWe reassure that Qatar's air defenses successfully thwarted the attack and\nintercepted the Iranian missiles. A detailed statement regarding the\ncircumstances of the attack will be issued later by the Ministry of Defense.\nWe also emphasize that the continuation of such escalatory military actions\nwill undermine security and stability in the region, dragging it into\nsituations that could have catastrophic consequences for international\npeace and security.\n\nWe call for the immediate cessation of all military actions and for a serious\nretum to the negotiating table and dialogue.\n\nFurthermore, the State of Qatar was one of the first countries to warn\nagainst the dangers of Israeli escalation in the region. We have consistently\ncalled for diplomatic solutions to be prioritized and have stressed the\nimportance of good-neighborliness and avoiding escalation.\n\nWe reaffirm that dialogue is the only way to overcome the current crises\nand ensure the security of the region and the peace of its people.\n\nThe base had been evacuated earlier, following established security and\nprecautionary measures, given the tensions in the region. All necessary\nsteps were taken to ensure the safety of personnel at the base, including\nQatari Armed Forces members, friendly forces, and others. We confirm that\nno injuries or human casualties resulted from the attack."
